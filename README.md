🚀 Just completed a fun project: Password Generator Application! 🔐

I’m excited to share a video walkthrough of my latest project—a Python-based password generator using Tkinter. This application allows users to:

Choose Password Strength: Options include Weak, Medium, and Strong.
Set Password Length: Choose from 5 to 18 characters.
Generate and Copy: Quickly generate and copy passwords with a single click.
Key Components:
Tkinter GUI: A user-friendly interface to interact with the application.
Password Strength Options: Customizable password strength levels based on user needs.
Dynamic Length Selection: Adjust password length easily using a spinbox.
Clipboard Integration: Copy passwords to the clipboard for easy use.
